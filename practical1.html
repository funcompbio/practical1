<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have your computer setup to work with the Unix command-line.</li>
<li>Download epidemiological data from the Catalan SIVIC network.</li>
<li>Create directories and navigate through the Unix filesystem.</li>
<li>Use the Unix online manual.</li>
<li>Copy, move and rename files.</li>
<li>Remove files and directories.</li>
<li>Explore file contents.</li>
<li>Redirect terminal output to a file.</li>
<li>Create your own GitHub profile.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>In this practical we will use some basic commands to navigate and
manipulate the Unix file system. You need to have access to a Unix <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line
interface (CLI)</a>. If you are doing this practical in your own
computer, please check the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> webpage to make
sure that you have access to some flavor of a Unix operating system and
its CLI.</p>
<p>To practise working with files from the Unix CLI we will download
epidemiological data from the SIVIC network, the infection surveillance
system of Catalonia (<em>Sistema d’Informació per a la Vigilància
d’Infeccions a Catalunya -SIVIC</em>). The SIVIC network portal
integrates data from primary care centers (<em>Centres d’Atenció
Primaria -CAPs</em>), clinical laboratories and hospitals throughout the
entire Catalonia; see the <a
href="https://sivic.salut.gencat.cat/documentacio">SIVIC help page</a>
and <a href="Infografia_SIVIC_V4-CAT.pdf">this infographic</a> (both in
Catalan) for additional information.</p>
<p>We will download two specific datasets from the SIVIC portal. Please
follow the next steps to successfully download them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the SIVIC portal at <a
href="https://sivic.salut.gencat.cat">https://sivic.salut.gencat.cat</a>.</li>
<li>Click on the link located at the top-right of the page called
“<em>Dades obertes</em>” (“open data”).</li>
<li>In the next page, under the section title “<em>Dades obertes</em>”,
click on the link “<em>Vigilància microbiològica sentinella a Atenció
Primària: mostres analitzades</em>” (“Primary care microbiological
sentinel surveillance: analysed samples”)</li>
<li>In the next page, click on the pull-down menu
“<em>Exporta</em>”.</li>
<li>In the pulled menu, click on the button labeled “CSV”. At this
point, depending on your browser configuration, either a pop-up window
appeared that allows you to select where do you want to store this file,
or the file has been automatically downloaded to a folder, typically
called “Downloads”, or “<em>Baixades</em>” in Catalan. If you are in
this latter case and unsure where the file has been downloaded, click on
the downloads button of your browser and you should be able to locate
the file in the filesystem. <strong>Please take note of the location and
the name of the downloaded file, i.e., its path in the
filesystem</strong>.</li>
<li>Press the going back button in your browser and repeat steps 3 to 5,
but this time following the link called “<em>Vigilància microbiològica
sentinella a Atenció Primària: virus detectats</em>” (“Primary care
microbiological sentinel surveillance: detected viruses”).</li>
</ol>
<p>The two files that you have downloaded should have the following
names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__mostres_analitzades.csv</code></li>
<li><code>Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__virus_detectats.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these two filenames end with <code>.csv</code>. A suffix
starting with a dot (<code>.</code>) at the end of a filename is called
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension">filename
extension</a> and, in general, it give us a hint on the type of contents
that the file stores. For instance, a file with extension
<code>.jpg</code> stores an image in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> format, while a file
with extension <code>.mp4</code> stores a video in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP4_file_format">MP4</a> format. In
our case, the <code>.csv</code> extension indicates that the downloaded
files have contents in the so-called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"><em>CSV</em></a>
format.</p>
<p>Think about why the filenames of the CSV files we have downloaded
have so many underscore characters (<code>_</code>).
<strong>Tip</strong>: checkout the concluding remarks of the lecture on
<a href="https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture2">Unix and the command
line</a>. Could you replace some of the underscore characters by
something else?</p>
<h1 id="creating-your-first-directory">Creating your first
directory</h1>
<p>Open a terminal window and figure out which is your username and your
default current working directory (CWD) by typing the commands
<code>whoami</code> (first) and <code>pwd</code> (second) on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt">command
prompt</a>. After you type each command you should press the
<code>Enter</code> key to ask the shell to execute the command. Your
interaction with the shell in the terminal window should look similar to
the following image.</p>
<p><img src="./terminaldefault.png" /></p>
<p>The command prompt may display different information to the left of
the cursor and usually ends with the dollar sign. The solely purpose of
the command prompt is to indicate where we can start typing commands,
while the purpose of the cursor is to indicate that the shell is waiting
for us to type commands. In the image above the command prompt it is
displaying the name of the host computer (<code>messi</code>) and the
the current CWD, which in this case corresponds to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory"><em>home</em>
directory</a> and for this reason is abbreviated with the tilde
<code>~</code>. In the image above the home directory is
<code>/Users/robert</code>, but tipically in a Unix system the home
directory would hang from a directory called <code>/home</code>.</p>
<p>Now, give the command to create a directory called
<code>practical1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir practical1</code></pre>
<p>To check whether we have successfully created a directory called
<code>practical1</code> we can use the command <code>ls</code> and
verify whether among the listed files we can find the name
<code>practical1</code>. The output of <code>ls</code> consists of the
names of every file in your current CWD. It may useful to distinguish
between regular files and directories, you can do that in different
ways, one of them using the option <code>-F</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -F</code></pre>
<p>You should see a trailing slash character <code>/</code> right after
the name of each file that is a directory, i.e., you should find for
instance <code>practical1/</code>.</p>
<h1 id="using-the-online-manual">Using the online manual</h1>
<p>The Unix system has online manual pages for each of its commands,
which can be accessed through the command <code>man</code> giving as
first argument the name of the command for which you want to read its
manual page. For instance, try to access the manual page of the command
<code>ls</code> by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ man ls</code></pre>
<p>All manual pages have the same structure of sections
<code>NAME</code>, <code>SYNOPSIS</code>, <code>DESCRIPTION</code>, etc.
and you can browse through it by using the <code>Enter</code> key to
scroll one line at a time, the <code>Space</code> key to scroll by page,
the <code>b</code> key to scroll one page backwards and the
<code>q</code> key to quit the manual.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can obtain summary of the contents of the manual page
by giving the option <code>--help</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls --help</code></pre>
<p>In fact, if you are on Windows using the Unix shell emulator <em>Git
Bash</em>, you will probably not be able to use the <code>man</code>
command and only the latter option will be available.</p>
<p>Using the manual page of the command <code>ls</code>, or the summary
of its options, checkout the meaning of the option <code>F</code>, and
also try to understand how the <code>mkdir</code> command is described.
Make sure you understand what is said in the section <code>NAME</code>
of the manual page, or at the beginning of the output of option
<code>--help</code>.</p>
<h1 id="changing-the-default-path-working-directory">Changing the
default path working directory</h1>
<p>We can change our default CWD to the new directory we have created
before by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd practical1</code></pre>
<p>To check whether we have successfully changed the CWD to the new
directory, use again the command <code>pwd</code>. We can move back to
the previous directory from where we moved our default access by
doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ..</code></pre>
<p>Here the two consecutive dot characters <code>..</code> indicate the
previous directory in the filesystem hiearchy. You can check out again
with <code>pwd</code> that after the previous command you have come back
to the directory from where you created <code>practical1</code>.</p>
<h1 id="copying-files">Copying files</h1>
<p>Locate the path where you have downloaded the two SIVIC data files
and use the <code>ls</code> command to verify that they are indeed
stored on that directory. If you have downloaded the two files in a
directory called <strong>for instance</strong> <code>Downloads</code>
located right below a home directory called <strong>for
instance</strong> <code>/Users/robert</code>, you can use the
<code>ls</code> command as follows to check out the presence of those
files in that directory</p>
<pre><code>$ ls /Users/robert/Downloads</code></pre>
<p>It may happen that you have lots of other files on that directory and
becomes difficult to distinguish whether your files of interest are
really there. In this case, because the two filenames have extension
<code>.csv</code>, you can use the so-called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character"><em>wildcard</em>
character</a> <code>*</code> to restrict the file listing operation to
those files having such an extension, by typing on the command-line:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls /Users/robert/Downloads/*.csv</code></pre>
<p>This command should show you only those files whose filenames end
with <code>.csv</code>, which should be the two you have downloaded in
this practical, and any other previous file with extention
<code>.csv</code> you had in that folder. Now, copy these CSV files to
your current brand new directory using the command <code>cp</code>.
<strong>For instance</strong>, if the files <strong>were</strong>
located at</p>
<pre><code>/Users/robert/Downloads</code></pre>
<p>then, the command to copy one of these two files to the current CWD
<strong>would be</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ cp /Users/robert/Downloads/Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__mostres_analitzades.csv .</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: the dot character ‘.’ in the second
argument of the <code>cp</code> command, indicates that the destination
of the file is your current CWD. To copy the CSV files into the
directory <code>practical1</code> using ‘.’ as destination, <strong>you
need to make sure that <code>practical1</code> is your current CWD
before writing the command to copy the files</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> when writing long paths it is useful to exploit
the so-called <em>tab-completion mechanism</em>, which consists of
pressing the <code>Tab</code> key (typically located above the
<code>Caps Lock</code> key) once you’ve written a few letters of a file
name in the path. If those few letters constitute a unique prefix of the
filename, the rest of the filename will be written for you by the shell.
If the prefix is not unique, by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key twice,
the shell will show your the two or more filenames that match that
prefix. Actually, the tab-completion mechanism also works for commands:
if you type <code>cp</code> and press <code>Tab</code>, the shell will
show you all the available commands that start with <code>cp</code>.</p>
<p>Note that because <code>/Users/robert</code> corresponds in this
example to the <em>home</em> directory of the user, we could use the
abbreviation <code>~</code>, corresponding to the <em>home</em>
directory, to write the previous command line as</p>
<pre><code>$ cp ~/Downloads/Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__mostres_analitzades.csv .</code></pre>
<p>Note that the previous command will work regardless of what is your
username, as long as the sought file is stored in the
<code>Downloads</code> directory. <strong>Tip:</strong> In keyboards
with a Spanish layout, the tilde <code>~</code> character can be written
by pressing the keys <code>AltGr+4</code> in Windows and Ubuntu, or
<code>Alt+n+space</code> in MacOS.</p>
<p>Now copy the second file. <strong>Tip:</strong> when you need to
repeat a previous command-line or your next command-line resembles
pretty much a previous one, you can use the up and down arrows to go
through the history of all the command-lines that you have typed before
to either repeat it by pressing enter or to modify it. In the previous
case, you can recover the previous command-line and replace the string
<code>mostres_analitzades</code> by <code>virus_detectats</code>.</p>
<p>Please verify using the command <code>ls</code> that the two files
are indeed in your current CWD. If you have been successful, you have
probably typed twice the <code>cp</code> command. However, because the
two filenames extension <code>*.csv</code>, you could have done the job
with one single command by using again the wildcard character
<code>*</code> as follows</p>
<pre><code>$ cp /Users/robert/Downloads/*.csv .</code></pre>
<h1 id="moving-or-renaming-files">Moving or renaming files</h1>
<p>Because you have <strong>copied</strong> the two files, after the
copy operation, the files remain intact in their original directory from
where you have copied them, e.g., in
<code>/Users/robert/Downloads</code> in the example above. A slightly
different operation is to <strong>move</strong> the files, because
<em>moving</em> removes the files from their original location after
they have been copied into their destination. The command to move the
files, instead of copy them, is <code>mv</code> with an analogous syntax
to <code>cp</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use the moving command <code>mv</code> to rename files.
For instance, the previously downloaded files have very long filenames,
which makes them a bit impractical to use them. Since most of the two
filenames start with the same text, we can rename the first of them to
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> as follows (assuming the file is
located in your CWD)</p>
<pre><code>$ mv Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__mostres_analitzades.csv mostres_analitzades.csv</code></pre>
<p>Please rename the second one to <code>virus_detectats.csv</code>.</p>
<h1 id="removing-files">Removing files</h1>
<p>There are two commands to remove files. One is <code>rmdir</code> and
the other is <code>rm</code>. Check their respective manual pages and
figure out what is the difference between these two commands by reading
only the <code>NAME</code> section.</p>
<p>We are going to illustrate the <code>rm</code> command as follows.
Because we have copied and renamed the downloaded data files, we can
remove the files from their original download location, this helps
releasing space from our hard disk and keeping tidy our downloads
folder. To remove the first downloaded file, assuming it was downloaded
in <code>/Users/robert/Downloads</code>, we should type the following
command</p>
<pre><code>$ rm ~/Downloads/Vigil_ncia_microbiol_gica_sentinella_a_Atenci__Prim_ria__mostres_analitzades.csv</code></pre>
<p>Now remove the second file from the downloads folder and check out
with the command <code>ls</code> that they indeed have been removed. We
could have also done this operation in one single command using the
wildcard character <code>*</code> as follows</p>
<pre><code>$ rm ~/Downloads/*.csv</code></pre>
<p>However, beware that this command would have removed
<strong>all</strong> files with extension <code>.csv</code> located in
the <code>~/Downloads</code> folder, which would have included the two
we downloaded and any other file you previously had on that folder with
identical extension.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: the Unix system has no bin were removed
files could go before being finally removed by emptying the bin. If you
accidentatlly remove a file through the <code>rm</code> or the
<code>rmdir</code> commands, <strong>you cannot recover it</strong>.
Because of that, you should pay attention when you use the wildcard
character <code>*</code>, because an unintended space character before
or after the <code>*</code> could imply <strong>removing all files of
your CWD or the target folder where you want to remove
files</strong>.</p>
<p>At this point, you have typed quite a few Unix commands and probably
have the terminal window full of text. Now and then you may want to
clear the terminal window. You can do that by either typing the command
<code>clear</code> or pressing the key combination
<code>Ctrl+l</code>.</p>
<h1 id="exploring-file-contents">Exploring file contents</h1>
<p>The two SIVIC data files that we have successfully downloaded, copied
into a folder and renamed have filename extension <code>.csv</code>.
This gives us two important pieces of information about those two
files:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The two files are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file"><em>text
files</em></a>.</li>
<li>The contents of those two files is in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"><em>CSV</em></a>
format.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point implies that we can inspect the contents of each of
the files from the command-line using any of the following Unix
commands</p>
<ul>
<li><code>head filename</code>: shows the contents of the beginning of a
file called <em>filename</em>.</li>
<li><code>tail filename</code>: shows the contents of the end of a file
called <em>filename</em>.</li>
<li><code>cat filename</code>: shows the entire contents of a file
called <em>filename</em>.</li>
<li><code>more filename</code>: like <code>cat</code> but paginating the
output. Use the <code>Enter</code> key to scroll line-by-line, the
<code>Space</code> key to scroll by pages and the <code>q</code> key to
quit. Modern Unix systems have also the command
<code>less filename</code>, which works like <code>more</code> but also
allows one to scroll the contents backwards using the key
<code>b</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second point implies that the contents are organized as a table,
where each line contains a record of the data and each record consists
of a given number of values separated by some delimiter character,
typically the comma character <code>,</code> but also the semicolon
<code>;</code>, sometimes the colon <code>:</code>, sometimes even the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters">tab
whitespace character</a>, etc. In a CSV file, the first line may contain
column names describing the kind of values stored in the rest of the
lines at the corresponding place.</p>
<p>Finally, a very useful command to summarize the contents of a text
file is <code>wc</code>, which provides the number of lines, words and
characters in a text file. When multiple files are given, either by
specifying their names one after each other or by using the wildcard
character (e.g., <code>*.csv</code>), those statistics are given for
each file and also their grand totals. Please try the <code>wc</code>
command on the CSV SIVIC data files.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> All these commands to explore file contents
may block the shell waiting for content if you forget to specify a
filename. In such a case, press the combination of keys
<code>Ctrl+d</code>, which send an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file">end-of-file (EOF)</a>
signal to the command and will immediately exit, giving you back the
control of the shell.</p>
<h1 id="redirect-terminal-output-to-a-file">Redirect terminal output to
a file</h1>
<p>A very useful feature of Unix is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_%28computing%29">redirection</a>,
sketched in the following picture</p>
<p><img src="./terminaloutputredirection.png" /></p>
<p>Here, we are going to see working example on what it means to
redirect the terminal output to a file. To redirect the terminal output
to a file we use the operator <code>&gt;</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ command &gt; file</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>command</code> is some program that generates output to
the terminal window and <code>file</code> is the name of the file where
we want this output to be written. For instance, try the following (it
will only work if you did correctly all the previous commands in this
practical, otherwise the file <code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> will
not be available for this example)</p>
<pre><code>$ head mostres_analitzades.csv &gt; test.txt</code></pre>
<p>Note that you cannot see anymore the output of the <code>head</code>
command on the terminal window. However, if you use the commands
<code>ls</code> and <code>cat test.txt</code>, you should be able to
identify a new file called <code>test.txt</code> and its contents
corresponding to the output of the <code>head</code> command.</p>
<p>Now, using this terminal output redirecting mechanism, create a file
that contains the number of lines of the two CSV SIVIC data files.</p>
<p>Using the <code>cat</code> command without a filename and the output
redirection can also be handy to quickly create a text file with a few
words. For instance, type the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &gt; test.txt
Hello world!</code></pre>
<p>Now press the EOF key combination (<code>Ctrl+d</code>) and verify
that the previous content of <code>test.txt</code> has dissapeared and
instead it has now only the words “Hello world!”.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You should note that running twice the terminal
redirection (<code>&gt;</code>) over the same file, overwrites
completely the initial contents of the file. To avoid overwritting the
content of a file, and adding instead the new content at the end, you
should use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> instead of <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<h1 id="create-your-own-github-profile">Create your own GitHub
